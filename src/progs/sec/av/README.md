**Version:** 0.0.7

Sandford Anti-Virus &amp; Anti-Malware

The goal of this project is to provide basic protection on Sandford OS against known threats.
It should also work on other platforms but please do not rely on it at all for them, 
use protection designed for your platform as sfdav will be almost entirely useless to you.
